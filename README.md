# Concept

This project idea was not original as before me there were already similar apps out there either for displaying use or deploying it to the app store. For me this was a just a passion project as a beginner chef lately, I wanted to provide a application for users to create and share recipes all in while other users can review it.

The application allows users to create a recipe with/without a picture, post,reviews without a page reload(ajax request), like the recipes, check out their own and other usersâ€™ profiles showcasing their recipes, and the app also displays the list of topics and posts with pagination.

Lastly, users can create new ingredients and recipes styles to effectively distinguish what type the recipe is and what ingredient it as as that was priority for me as a safety concern(allergy reasons, etc.) for the users.

# Sign Up

When going the url, the user is treated with a simple login page in which users can sign in/sign up, tabs in which guests or users who are not loggin can still navigate.

To start off, a User has choice of signing up or signing in a created account.
Once a user has created an account, they will get redirect the main recipies page.

# Styles and Ingredients

A recipe has to have ingredients and different styles of cooking for that recipe,so this feature allows users to create a new style or a ingredient and use it as tag when creating a new recipe.

Additionally, when clicking on the selected style, it will show a list of recipe with the selected style. If it's a certain ingredient was selected, then it will show a list of recipe with the selected ingredient.
